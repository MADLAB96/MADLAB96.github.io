## HHKB Pro 2

{{ resize_image(path="photos/hhkb.jpg", width=750, height=750, op="fit") }}

My current everyday keyboard, the [HHKB Pro 2](https://www.hhkeyboard.com/uk/products/pro2/). This is the older model that I purchased second hand off of [/r/mechmarket](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/). It definitely took me a while to get used to this one, but once I modded it with silencing rings, lube, and the keycaps it is probably my favorite. 

In the future I'll want to continue to mod this with:
* Cherry stems + a GMK set
* Bluetooth
* KBDFans currently has an [IC](https://kbdfans.com/products/ic-hello-v1-keyboard-case?_pos=24&_sid=d58e216e6&_ss=r) for a premium case ðŸ‘€

## KBD75v2

The sassy boy is Tombo btw. 

This is my first *real* custom build that I finished sometime in March 2020. I had just started a new job and decided to hop right into the hobby with a fully custom, mid-range build. The whole thing ended up being about $400 in total, but honestly probably more with the soldering equipment and other stuff that was needed. 

Here's the bill of materials:
* Lubed Gateron Ink Blacks
* [KBD75v2 DIY Kit](https://kbdfans.com/products/kbd75v2-custom-keyboard-diy-kit?_pos=8&_sid=6745977fa&_ss=r) w/usb-c and aluminum plate (no case foam though ðŸ˜¥)
* [MAXKEY SA MO CHOCO KEYCAPS R2](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=102814.0)

Back then I didn't even know what a group buy was so looking back on it now I was pretty lucky to get a set of these from KBDFans since it was likely extra stock. 

Sadly this is not my favorite anymore, and there is a few reasons for this. 
1)  The function layout being cramped like that makes it super easy to fat finger the escape key. This got me killed more than a few times in DOTA.
2)  The lube that I used on the keys and the stablizers was [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002L5UL92/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and it sadly did not last long. After about a month the stablizers sounded like stock again and I haven't been able to fix this.
3)  Lots of lessions learned, and since I no longer need the function row (bye bye DOTA) I'll be sticking to the compact boards.
